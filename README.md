# MiniTarball

This is a **minimal** implementation of the [GNU Tar format](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/manual/html_chapter/tar_15.html) in Ruby.

#### üëç Supported features
* Writing tar files
* Adding files with
  * unlimited file size
  * unlimited file name length
* Unicode file names
* Works with streams, so there's no need to waste disk space by creating temporary files

#### üëé Currently not supported features
* Reading tar files
* Adding hardlinks, symlinks or directories
* Other features of GNU tar like sparse files
* Creating POSIX.1-2001 (pax) archives or any other tar format

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

``` ruby
gem 'mini_tarball'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mini_tarball

## Usage

### Create a `MiniTarball::Writer`
There are multiple ways for creating a `MiniTarball::Writer`:

1. Use an existing IO-like stream.
   ``` ruby
   io =  File.open(archive_path, "wb")
   MiniTarball::Writer.use(io) do |writer|
     # add files by calling writer.add_file or writer.add_file_from_stream
   end
   ```

2. Create a new file by supplying a file name.
   ``` ruby
   MiniTarball::Writer.create(filename) do |writer|
     # add files by calling writer.add_file or writer.add_file_from_stream
   end
   ```

3. Create it manually. You need to close the writer when you are done in order finalize the tar file.
   ``` ruby
   writer = MiniTarball::Writer.new(io)
   # add files by calling writer.add_file or writer.add_file_from_stream
   writer.close
   ```

### Add files

You can add existing files as well as write a stream into the tar file.

#### Add existing files
You can add existing files by calling `MiniTarball::Writer#add_file`. The required `name` argument can be a file name or a complete path.

``` ruby
writer.add_file(name: "file1.txt", source_file_path: "/home/foo/file1.txt")
```

By default the file's attributes are stored in the tar file, but you can override them by supplying values for the optional arguments (`mode`, `uname`, `gname`, `uid`, `gid`, `mtime`) to `MiniTarball::Writer#add_file`.

#### Add files from a stream
You can add files of unknown size by calling `MiniTarball::Writer#add_file_from_stream`. The required `name` argument can be a file name or a complete path.

> üí° This method doesn't work with non-seekable streams like `Zlib::GzipWriter`.

Here are some examples:

* Use IO.copy_stream to efficiently copy a stream into the tar
   ``` ruby
   File.open("/home/foo/file1.txt", "rb") do |input_stream|
     writer.add_file_from_stream(name: "file1.txt") do |output_stream|
       IO.copy_stream(input_stream, output_stream)
     end
   end
   ```

* Directly write into the output stream
   ``` ruby
   writer.add_file_from_stream(name: "foo/bar/file2.txt") do |output_stream|
     output_stream.write("Hello world!")
   end
   ```

`MiniTarball::Writer#add_file_from_stream` has multiple optional arguments:

|Argument|Default|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|
|mode|`0644`|Permission and mode bits|
|uname|`"nobody"`|User name of file owner|
|gname|`"nogroup"`|Group name of file owner|
|uid|`nil`|User ID of file owner|
|gid|`nil`|Group ID of file owner|
|mtime|`Time.now.utc`|Modification time|

#### Add placeholder
Placeholders allow you to reserve space for a file within the tar. That's quite useful when you want to store a file at the beginning of the archive, but don't know the file content until you have added other files to the archive.

You don't need to know the exact size of the file when you add the placeholder. The writer will fill unused space with ‚êÄ characters if the actual file is smaller than the reserved `file_size`. Adding a file that is larger than `file_size` will raise `MiniTarball::WriteOutOfRangeError`.

``` ruby
placeholder1 = writer.add_file_placeholder(name: "file1.txt", file_size: 3925)
placeholder2 = writer.add_file_placeholder(name: "file2.txt", file_size: 1950)
# add more files...

# fill placeholder 1
writer.with_placeholder(placeholder1) do |w|
  w.add_file(name: "file1.txt", source_file_path: "/home/foo/file1.txt")
end

# fill placeholder 2
writer.with_placeholder(placeholder2) do |w|
  File.open("/home/foo/file9.txt", "rb") do |input_stream|
    w.add_file_from_stream(name: "file9.txt") do |output_stream|
      IO.copy_stream(input_stream, output_stream)
    end
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then push it to GitHub. This will automatically create a tag and publish the gem on [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

On MacOS you need to run `brew install gnu-tar`, otherwise some specs will fail.

### RubyCritic

You can run `SimpleCov` and `RubyCritic` by executing the following:

```
COVERAGE=1 rake spec && rubycritic --no-browser
```
